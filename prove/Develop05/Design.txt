            Save - Save goals to file.
            Load - Load goals from saved file.
            ------------
            // Shared functions:
            Name - Name the goal.
            Describe - Tell what the goal is.
            Points - How many points is the goal worth.
            ---------------
            Record - (polymorphism) - this we be different for each class.

            Name - Name the goal.
            Describe - Tell what the goal is.
            Points - How many points is the goal worth.

            Name - Name the goal.
            Describe - Tell what the goal is.
            Points - How many points is the goal worth.
            -------------------
            Record - Give points each time the goal is meet. This goal will never be completed. Add points to point Total.

CheckGoal{
            Name - Name the goal.
            Describe - Tell what the goal is.
            Points - How many points is the goal worth.
            ------------
            Record - Add points to goal as each step is completed.
                     Give bonuses points when all step of goal are completed.
                     Add points to point Total.

            BaseGoal - class will be used to hold the defined functions and methods for all the heratied classes.
            SimpleGoal - Will be goals that are easy to complete one step goals.
            EntralGoal - These goals will be a daily goal that will never be complete but will get point each time it is done.
            CheckGoal - Will a goals that have a goal that will be done in user choice of times. Every time the goal has been
                            done the user will recive points and the step will mark it has been completed some many times until
                            the user has completed the goal the set number of times. Eample user pick goal to be completed 3 times.
                            Each time the goal is done the counter will increase until the goal reads 3 of 3.
            
            SimpleGoal, EntralGoal, and CheckGoal will all inharate from the BaseGoal class. The "Record" function in each class will
            different so this will be a polymorphism funciton. 

            The goals will be saved into a file using the save Method.
            The goals can be load againg using the Load method.
            The goal list will hold all the goals.
            Total points will keep track of the points gained when the goals are completed. Points will be saved in the save file so
                that they can be recalled.
            
            The Quit option will end the program.
